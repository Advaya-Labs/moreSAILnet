# moreSAILnet
This is a fork of the original SAILnet MATLAB code by Dr. Zoel Zylberberg available at http://faculty.washington.edu/joelzy/sailcodes.html. Dr. Zylberberg is the author and owner of this code. Any user (including me) of this code must acknowledge the original author. This code is for academic purposed only. Anyone who wishes to use this code for other purposes must contact the orginal author, Dr. Zoel Zylberberg (http://faculty.washington.edu/joelzy/)


SAILnet implements the algorithm described in Zylberberg, Murphy & DeWeese (2011) "A sparse coding model with synaptically local plasticity and spiking neurons can account for the diverse shapes of V1 simple cell receptive fields", PLoS Computational Biology 7(10). and that paper should be cited by any work stemming from use of SAILnet.
